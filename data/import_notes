### Data Import Process

Due to multiple delimiters in the CSV (mix of commas, semicolons, and quotes),  
data was imported using **SQL Server Import Wizard** instead of manual insert by `BULK INSERT`.

Steps:
1. Used “Flat File Import Wizard” in SSMS.
2. Checked delimiters and text qualifiers (`" "`).
3. Validated data types and null handling post-import.
